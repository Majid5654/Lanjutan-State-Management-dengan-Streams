# Lab 1: Dart Streams

## Question 1

Add your nickname to title the app as an identity for your work.

Change the application theme color according to your preference.

```.dart:
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stream-Erwan Majid',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.brown[100]),
      home: const StreamHomePage(),
    );
  }
```
